# Autonomous Agent Project

This project implements an autonomous agent that demonstrates asynchronous communication, proactive behavior, and reactive message handling. The agent is designed to handle messages from an inbox, respond to certain keywords, and generate random messages based on predefined behaviors.

## Project Structure

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Only used the Python standard library.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd autonomous_agent

- Create and activate a virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv autonomous_agent_env
    source autonomous_agent_env/bin/activate
    Install dependencies: Since the project relies only on the Python standard library, no additional installations are needed.

- Running the Project
    You can run the project using the main.py script. This will create and start two autonomous agents that send messages to each other.

    python main.py

- Running Tests
    To run the unit and integration tests:

    Ensure your virtual environment is activated:

    source autonomous_agent_env/bin/activate
    Run the tests using pytest:

    pytest

- Implementation Details:
    AutonomousAgent Class
    The AutonomousAgent class provides the basic structure for an agent, including:

        . Asynchronous message handling: Uses Python's queue.Queue to manage messages.
        . Reactive behavior: Allows for the registration of handlers that react to specific keywords in messages.
        . Proactive behavior: Supports behaviors that generate new messages based on internal state or a timer.

- ConcreteAgent Class

    The ConcreteAgent class is a specific implementation of AutonomousAgent. It includes:

        . Message handler: Prints messages containing the keyword "hello".
        . Behavior: Generates random two-word messages every 2 seconds from a predefined list of words.

- Feedback and Future Improvements

        . The design could be extended to allow for more complex message types and protocols.
        . Future enhancements could include dynamic behavior modification at runtime.
